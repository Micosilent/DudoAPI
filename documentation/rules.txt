- Dudo is a dice game for 2-8 players

- On game start each player is given 5 dice. 
- If a player loses all their dice, they lose. 
- The last remaining player wins the game.

- Each round consists of the following phases:
    - Players roll their dice
    - Players watch only their own dice results
    - Players bet on how many dice of a given value there are 
    - At any point any player can spot/kill/call the bid
    - All dice are shown, and the winner and loser are identified
    - Loser loses a dice (with some specific exception)

- How players bid:
    - The first player proposes a dice value and a dice quantity.
    - The next player can increase the quantity of that same dice value, or can bid any ammount of dice of a higher value
    - The player who is in turn can decide to bid or to end the round by accepting the last player's bet

- How to accept the last player's bet: call/kill/spot:
    - A bid must exist prior to accepting a bet
    - CALL: 
        - The player that calls the latest bid "says" that there are not that many dice of such value.
        - All the dice of all players are revealed
        - If there are equal or more dice than the bidded quantity, the bidder wins, and the "caller" loses
        - If there were less dice of that value than the bidded quantity, the "caller" wins
        - The loser loses a dice
    - KILL/SPOT: 
        - Similarly, the player that kills the latest bid "says" that there are exactly that many dice of such value.
        - All the dice of all players are revealed
        - If there is an equal ammount of dice than the bidded quantity, the "killer"/"spotter" wins, and the bidder loses
        - Else, the bidder wins
    - KILL: The loser loses a dice
    - SPOT: The winner wins a dice/extra life (no more than 5 dice can be held at the same time)

- Special rounds:
    - For each player, the first time that they get to have a single dice (they're about to lose), they can chose an special round type:
        - BLIND: no player can see their dice excepting for the player that selected the round type
        - OPEN: each player will reveal their dice to the others, and will not be able to see their own dice
    - This is a one time event for each player
